  abstract  = {In this introductory piece to the Globe and Mail's “Mastering It” series, Adam Gopnik explores the paradoxical value of imperfection in the pursuit of mastery. Drawing from examples in music, sports, magic, and personal experience, he argues that expressive flaws and human variability are not only signs of authenticity but essential to aesthetic and emotional resonance. The essay discusses the 'Too Perfect Trick' theory in magic as a key metaphor for the dangers of over-perfection in performance and politics.},
