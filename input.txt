  abstract = {Published to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Stephen Walker's long-form article revisits the events of August 1945 through the lens of firsthand testimony from the now-deceased American flight crews who carried out the missions. Drawing from previously unpublished interviews conducted two decades earlier, Walker reconstructs the detailed preparation, emotional responses, and retrospective reflections of pilots, bombardiers, and scientists involved in both missions. The article situates these accounts in contemporary nuclear discourse, underscoring their historical and ethical significance as nuclear proliferation threats intensify globally. It provides a nuanced, human-centred portrayal of the crews, contrasting operational pride with glimpses of moral ambivalence, and reflects on how memory, war, and technological power intersect in a world still living in the shadow of Hiroshima.},
