  abstract     = {This first volume of Helen Spencer’s institutional history of the Early English Text Society (EETS) reconstructs the intellectual and personal networks behind its founding. Focusing on the period from Frederick James Furnivall’s birth in 1825 to the founding of EETS in 1864, Spencer details how the Society aligned scholarly incentives with the data-gathering needs of the Philological Society’s New English Dictionary project (later the OED). The book demonstrates that the EETS acted as a 19th-century scholarly data infrastructure, mobilising volunteer editors and legitimising textual production as a professional scholarly activity—anticipating models of data-driven research in the digital humanities.},
