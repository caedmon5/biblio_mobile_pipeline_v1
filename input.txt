Published anonymously, this edition was experimental in its emphasis on everyday language and rural life.},

It introduced the famous "Preface," where Wordsworth articulates his poetic theory: a focus on common subjects, ordinary language, and the role of imagination. This edition solidified the philosophical foundation of Romantic poetry and marked a significant editorial and authorial shift, with Wordsworth now named as the author.},

While the textual changes are modest, the Preface significantly extends his earlier theoretical argument.},
