  abstract     = {This review explores the molecular genetics of lactase persistence in humans and contrasts it with the ancestral condition of lactase non-persistence. It emphasizes that in most mammals, including the majority of humans, lactase expression declines following weaning, aligning with species-specific developmental timelines. The article examines regulatory mutations associated with continued lactase expression and traces their evolutionary trajectories in dairying populations.},
