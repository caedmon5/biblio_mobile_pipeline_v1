  abstract  = {In this reflective opinion piece, philosopher Mark Kingwell argues that the rise of AI technologies undermines both the traditional functions and very purpose of the modern university. He contends that when students use AI to take notes, draft, and revise assignments — and universities respond with their own detection tools — education devolves into a closed loop of surveillance and artificial output. Kingwell critiques both academic overproduction and AI-fuelled replacement of writing, concluding that meaningful human learning, and especially philosophical inquiry, requires engagement that machines cannot replicate.},
