  abstract  = {In this introductory essay for the Globe and Mail's “Mastering It” series, Adam Gopnik explores the paradox of perfection in mastery. He draws on examples from music, sport, magic, and the arts to argue that expressive imperfection is a core component of compelling performance. He discusses the 'Too Perfect Trick Theory' from magic as a central metaphor for why perfect execution often weakens, rather than strengthens, artistic or experiential impact.},

While primarily practical, it includes reflections on performance theory, including early articulations of what would become known as the Too Perfect Theory: the idea that an overly clean or flawless trick can expose its method by eliminating plausible alternatives.},
